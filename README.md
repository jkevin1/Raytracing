Raytracing
==========

**_Note: This project has become my Independent Study project over the spring 2015 semester and will be using NVIDIA OptiX and an end goal of using global illumination, hopefully with decent fps for real-time playback.  A separate repo will be created once development begins, it is currently in the research stage._**

Creating a simple raytracing renderer for fun.
I made a raytracer in class a while ago and I'm remaking it such that it is faster and has more features.

Here is sample output from my old raytracer with Phong lighting, shadows, and reflections.

Here is current output, it has Phong lighting and shadows.
