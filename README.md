Raytracing
==========

Creating a simple raytracing renderer for fun.
I made a raytracer in class a while ago and I'm remaking it such that it is faster and has more features.

Here is sample output from my old raytracer with Phong lighting, shadows, and reflections.

Here is current output, it has Phong lighting and shadows.

Here is the output without any shading.
